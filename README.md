**1. Motion and Looks Blocks**

**Motion Blocks**: These blocks are responsible for controlling the movement of sprites, such as moving forward, rotating, etc.
**Looks Blocks**: These blocks allow you to change the appearance of the sprite, including displaying messages, changing costumes, etc.

**2. Drag and Drop Interface**
You can drag and drop motion and look blocks from the left sidebar to the middle section (MidArea) to create groups of actions.
Each dropped block will automatically be added to the nearest group if within a certain boundary; otherwise, a new group is created.

**3. Grouping Actions**
Actions dropped in close proximity in the MidArea will automatically form a group.
Each group of actions can be run independently by clicking the Run button specific to that group.

**4. Run and Replay Buttons**
Run Button: Located at the top, this button will execute all selected blocks in sequence.
Replay Button: Allows you to replay the sequence of actions that were previously run.

**5. Individual Group Execution**
Each group of actions in the MidArea has its own Run button, which allows you to run only the actions within that specific group.
This is useful for testing or executing different sequences independently.
